1. A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java.
   It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
2. Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
3. An interface is declared by using the interface keyword.
   It provides total abstraction; means all the methods in an interface are declared with the empty body,
   and all the fields are public, static and final by default.
   A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
